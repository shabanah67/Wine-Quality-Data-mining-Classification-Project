Wine Quality Data mining Classification Project

Abstract:
The main purpose of this study is to predict wine quality based on physicochemical data.
In this study, The dataset was taken from Kaggle. These data sets contain 11 features of
physicochemical data such as alcohol, chlorides, density, total sulfur dioxide, free sulfur dioxide,
residual sugar, and pH. First, We successfully classified the quality into Low, Medium, and High
where a score of 3, 4, and 5 are low quality, 6 and 7 are medium quality, and 8 and 9 are high
quality. Then, the following four different data mining algorithms were used to classify the
quality of wine: multiclass decision jungle, multiclass logistic regression, multiclass neural
network, Multiclass Decision Forest. We have conducted descriptive statistics on the quality of
wines. We also used Permutation Feature Importance to determine what are the most important
attributes that decide the quality of the wines.

Data Characteristics:
Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes ( Mgmarques). T here are
many different factors that can influence the quality of wine. This is why paying attention to
every detail that goes into each bottle is very important (“Fresh Vine Wine”). In the particular
data set that we chose the attributes are alcohol, volatile acidity, free sulfur dioxide, residual
sugar, sulphates, pH, chlorides, density, total sulfur dioxide, citric acid, fixed acidity, and quality.
Of these included, alcohol, volatile acidity, free sulfur dioxide, residual sugar, sulphates, pH,
chlorides, density, total sulfur dioxide, citric acid, and fixed acidity are all independent variables.
Of all the attributes this only leaves quality. This is because quality of the wine is the dependent
variable that all of the other variables included in the data set are influencing.

DM Model Construction:
we used 4 models including multiclass decision forest,
multiclass decision jungle, multiclass logistic and multiclass neural networks. Classification
Multi-Class is in the example we have classified the quality of a wine with the attributes “Good”
and “Bad”, in this example we will analyze the quality of a wine with numbers between 0 and
10. To do this we must use other Multi-Class classification algorithms but the principle remains
the same. Deep Neural Network is the most simple neural network is the "perceptron", which, in
its simplest form, consists of a single neuron. The perceptrons only work with numerical data, so,
you should convert any nominal data into a numerical format.

Analysis:
Wines industry is a complicated and expensive field that people who are interested in the field
need to know exactly what they need to deal with. Besides a large amount of investment (about
$1 million) to get started, farm work all year round, complex paperwork as well as fatigue sale
legwork, people cannot get revenue until several years of losses. By being an expert in the
process of making wines along with exploring the key ingredients to produce high-quality wines,
businesses can make up to 8 to 9 figures of money. Focusing on the main attributes, producers
carefully weigh and adjust the amount of each attribute so that all the ingredients in each bottle
can be in harmony which can lead to the key to success in the wine industry.
The attributes that make the best wine could be of interest to a CEO or winery owner. In
America, many celebrities are creating their own wine labels, so it is important for them to know
how to make a competitive wine for the market. Ex) Fresh Vine Wine by Julianne Hough and
Nina Dobrev and Spade and Sparrows by Kaitlyn Bristowe.
